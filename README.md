Audit Bot is a simple open source discord bot which will scan your basic server's settings and potential vulnerablilities. It'll scan through roles and server settings, it may even safe you from raid or spambot attack. It automates searching and points out what should be changed. 
This includes:
  - What roles are mentionable.
  - What roles have dangerous permissions.
  - What settings in your server should be changed.

# Features

  - Scanning single vectors or performing a full scan. All of those returning a nice and clear report.
  - Customizable Prefix (temporarily disabled)
  - Availability for Administrators only for secure usage to prevent eventual vulnerabilites disclosure.

### Installation

To get it working you just have to invite bot to your server by clicking the following link and authorizing it in selected server.
```sh
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=592664964393598987&scope=bot&permissions=8
```
### Usage
Mention the bot to view help.

### Development

Although this bot is working (version 1.0.0) it's not complete. There are far more things i'd like to make (for example customizable prefix) or others. Even when hack week will end i'll try to continue developing it further. 

### Author Notes
- This bot is mainly created for Discord Hack Week competition.
- I'm relatively new to developing discord bots, so some things may seem weird.
- Permissions command may look broken due to quick fix for message symbols limit.
